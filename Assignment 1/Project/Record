batch = 32, epoch = 100
TRAIN ACCURACY: 96.4 
TEST ACCURACY: 37.6
- overtrained?

increased batch to 64, decreased epoch to 50
added early stopping and restore best weights
TRAIN ACCURACY: 93.4
TEST ACCURACY: 33.3
- stopped at epoch 31

increased kernel size of conv to 5x5 for both
TRAIN ACCURACY: 89.7
TEST ACCURACY: 30.0
-stopped at epoch 41

kernel size back to 3x3
try batch 32 again
TRAIN ACCURACY: 94.6
TEST ACCURACY: 32.1
-stopped at 48

get rid of early stopping, increase epoch to 70, get rid of 1st maxpool to try to avoid generalizing
TRAIN ACCURACY: 98.7
TEST ACCURACY: 30.0

epochs=40, dropout 0.2 after 1st conv
TRAIN ACCURACY: 95.8
TEST ACCURACY: 28.8

no more dropout
2nd conv layer is 64
using elu instead
TRAIN ACCURACY: 97.0
TEST ACCURACY: 30.6

reset to original, epoch 40, instead of relu use elu
TRAIN ACCURACY: 
TEST ACCURACY: 31.8
